            empower you to discover those reasons, reignite your motivation, and choose the path that can lead to a

            However, we acknowledge that life is far from perfect. We might recommend many things, such as setting a
            sleep
            routine, but we understand that unforeseen circumstances or personal preferences can disrupt even the
            best-laid
            plans. We encourage you to adopt a growth mindset, one that values progress over perfection. Just like you,
            we
            embrace this philosophy.
            We firmly believe that emotions, knowledge, and support are your most potent tools for achieving your goals.

            your partners on this journey, we're committed to providing you with the knowledge and support you need. Our
            aim

            <h2>Apply and identify schema therapy principles</h2>
            <p>
                Inspired by the work of Jeffrey Young, to help individuals identify and modify dysfunctional schemas.
                (There are a lot of ways to know people better, one of the more functional found in psychology is
                identifying their schemas, which are the ideas they generated early in life and along all their life
                about what they value, what are they scared of or what situations they will avoid by all costs, what is
                their purpose on life, how worthy they are, and other ideas) we use those schemas to identify what
                things might be troubling them.

                We have found out that most of the good or bad habits that we have are built on the motivation of the schema we have, we can develop better habits if we use the knowledge of the schemas.
